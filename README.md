# fantasy_football_ingestion_script

This python script will tap public Sleeper APIs and convert the response to CSV files locally.

## future improvements
This is my first script since learning python. Given this, I anticipate future improvements to code for readability, dryness, and efficiency.

These is a list of next steps:
1. Create subfolders for each CSV data type within "sleeper_data" folder.
2. Condense/group functions more efficiently.
3. Clean Transaction CSV outputs (nested lists and dictionaries).
4. Re-think description of steps.
5. Test with multiple league_ids.
